;;; wn-model.el --- numeric window switching shortcuts -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;; Keywords: buffers windows switching-windows

;; This library was found at the Emacs Wiki and is probably in the
;; public domain.

;;; Commentary:

;; This library defines a global minor mode called `wn-mode' that adds
;; keyboard shortcuts to quickly switch between visible windows within
;; the current Emacs frame.
;;
;; To activate, simply add
;;   (wn-mode)
;; to your `~/.emacs'.
;;
;; By default, the shortcuts are M-1, ..., M-9, M-0, M-#.
;;
;; Customize `wn-keybinding-format' if you wish to use different key
;; bindings, e.g.:
;;   (setq wn-keybinding-format "C-c %s")
;;
;; Invoke M-x remake-wn-mode-map if you want it to take effect
;; immediately.

;;; Code:

(defun wn--window-list ()
  "Return a list of ordered windows on the current frame."
  (window-list (selected-frame) 0 (minibuffer-window)))

;;;###autoload
(defun wn-select-nth (n)
  "Select window number N in current frame."
  (interactive "nWindow number: ")
  (let ((window (nth (1- n) (wn--window-list))))
    (if window
        (select-window window)
        (message "No such window."))))

(defun wn--selected-window-number ()
  "Return the number of the selected window"
  ;; this strange implementation avoids a dependency on cl-position!

  "Return the string for the current window modeline."
  (propertize (format " #%s" (wn--selected-window-number))
              'face 'wn-modeline-face))

(defvar wn-keybinding-format "M-%s"
  "Define how the numeric keybindings should be set up.

convenient but overrides built-in Emacs keybindings.")
